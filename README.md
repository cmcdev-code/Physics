# Physics
This is a particle simulation that I am currently working on. 
This is a newer version that I am trying to make better then my previous attempt at one.
With this one I plane on abstracting things more such as the graphics vs the actual logic in the physics.

Some things that I plan on adding into this version in not particular order..
  A way to save the state of the system and load it up again 
  A grid system that will provide a much faster simulation at the cost of some realism.
  A easy way to see the total ammount of energy in the system.
  A way to test differnt changes and see how they effect the system easier.
